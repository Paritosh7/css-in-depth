1. Only vertical margins collapse.

2. Margin collapse is unique to Flow layout. If you have children inside a display: flex parent, those children's margins will never collapse.

3. Any element between two others will block margins from collapsing. Elements need to be adjacent in the DOM for their margins to collapse.

4. The bigger margin always wins. 

5. Nesting doesn't prevent collapsing - 

    a. Margin is meant to increase the distance between siblings. It is not meant to increase the gap between a child and its parent's bounding box; that's what padding is for.

    b. Margin will always try and increase distance between siblings, even if it means transferring margin to the parent element!

6. Margins only collapse when they are touching - 

    a. Any sort of gap, be it padding or border gap will not cause margin collapse.
