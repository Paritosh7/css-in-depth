1. Only vertical margins collapse.

2. Margin collapse is unique to Flow layout. If you have children inside a display: flex parent, those children's margins will never collapse.

3. Any element between two others will block margins from collapsing. Elements need to be adjacent in the DOM for their margins to collapse.

4. The bigger margin always wins.
